#A simple analysis of the problem shows us that the smallest missing number would be the elementâ€™s index, which is not equal to its element. For instance, consider array [0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15]. Here, the smallest missing element is 3 since 6 is present at index 3 (instead of element 3). If all elements in the array are at their right position, then the smallest missing number is equal to the array size; For instance, 6 in the case of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].#
# Function to find the smallest missing element in a sorted
# list of distinct non-negative integers
def findSmallestMissing(nums, left=None, right=None):
 
    # initialize left and right
    if left is None and right is None:
        (left, right) = (0, len(nums) - 1)
 
    # base condition
    if left > right:
        return left
 
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2
 
    # if the mid-index matches with its value, then the mismatch
    # lies on the right half
    if nums[mid] == mid:
        return findSmallestMissing(nums, mid + 1, right)
 
    # mismatch lies on the left half
    else:
        return findSmallestMissing(nums, left, mid - 1)
